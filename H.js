Adding `.env` to your `.gitignore` file will not automatically remove it from GitLab or your repository's history. It will simply ensure that future changes to the `.env` file are not tracked by Git. If you want to remove the `.env` file from GitLab, you'll need to manually untrack it.

Hereâ€™s how you can handle this situation:

1. **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`**: Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to ensure that it is ignored in the future.

   ```plaintext
   .env
   ```

2. **Untrack the `.env` File**: To remove the `.env` file from the repository but keep it on your local filesystem, use the following command:

   ```bash
   git rm --cached .env
   ```

   This command stops tracking the `.env` file without deleting it from your local directory.

3. **Commit the Changes**: Commit this change to your repository.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Stop tracking .env file"
   ```

4. **Push the Changes to GitLab**: Push the commit to your GitLab repository.

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

### Summary of Commands

```bash
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
git rm --cached .env
git commit -m "Stop tracking .env file"
git push origin your-branch-name
```

After following these steps, the `.env` file will no longer be tracked by Git, and future changes to the `.env` file will be ignored. The `.env` file will still exist in the repository history, but it won't appear in the latest commit or be tracked going forward.
